## 🧩 Steps I Took to Build Crypton

1. **Project Planning & Setup** 🏗️  
   - Defined the scope and key features.  
   - Initialized a **Vite + React 19 project**.  
   - Configured ESLint and structured folders for scalability.  

2. **Building Components** 🖥️  
   - Developed reusable **dashboard cards** for crypto stats.  
   - Added **charts** to visualize trends.  
   - Implemented **search and filter functionality**.  

3. **Integrating APIs** 🌐  
   - Connected to public cryptocurrency APIs.  
   - Fetched live prices and historical market data.  
   - Managed asynchronous data fetching with **React hooks**.  

4. **Handling Live Updates** ⚡  
   - Integrated **WebSocket connections** for automatic price updates.  
   - Optimized **state management** to reduce unnecessary re-renders.  

5. **Deployment to GitHub Pages** 📦  
   - Configured `vite.config.js` with the correct `base` path.  
   - Built the project and deployed via **GitHub Actions**.  
   - Fixed 404 issues by ensuring proper asset paths and SPA routing.

## ⚠️ Challenges & Lessons Learned

- **React Router + GitHub Pages 404** ❌  
  - Initial refresh caused 404 errors.  
  - Solved by creating a **404.html redirect** and configuring `base` in Vite.  

- **WebSocket State Management** 🔄  
  - Frequent live updates caused performance issues.  
  - Resolved by optimizing state updates and using `useRef` when needed.  

- **API Rate Limits** ⏱️  
  - Too many API requests caused throttling.  
  - Implemented caching and throttling to avoid hitting limits.
